                <h2>Incident 3: Misleading Auto-Pay Refund Experience on Google Play</h2>
                <div class="incident-summary">
                    <p><b>Brief summary:</b> A game pass that was supposed to be “free for the first month” unexpectedly
                        charged me ₹899. I later found out the offer was linked to the payment method, not the Google
                        account. I contacted Google Pay for help and waited for days, but they only told me to reach out
                        to Digital Sathi and my bank before finally suggesting I email Google Play support. After all
                        the effort, Google Play apologized but said they couldn’t help due to their policies and asked
                        me to contact the game developer instead. This experience showed how confusing subscriptions and
                        fragmented refund processes make it nearly impossible for regular consumers to receive fair treatment.

                    <p><b>Full detailed story:</b> On 12th September 2025, I purchased a “first month free” pass for a
                        mobile
                        game. I already had two in-game accounts — my first activation went smoothly and showed ₹0
                        charge, so I confidently tried the same process for my second account.

                        The Google Pay interface looked identical — no visible difference or warning about existing
                        trials. Even the in-game instructions clearly said that users could “activate auto-pay and
                        deactivate it later to enjoy the free month.” But the next day, on 13th September, I noticed
                        ₹899 had been deducted from my account. That’s when I realized the so-called “free trial” wasn’t
                        based on my Google account but on my payment method itself — something that was never disclosed
                        beforehand.

                        I immediately contacted Google Pay support the same day. Initially, they gave automated
                        responses, and for a full week, there was no real follow-up. Eventually, I received a call from
                        a Google Pay support agent while I was at the bazaar with my uncle. I still remember how
                        confusing the conversation was — I even recorded it for clarity. The lady asked me to contact
                        Digital Sathi and my bank, saying they could assist better. After I pressed for clearer
                        instructions, she finally told me to mail Google Play directly using a specific address she
                        provided.

                        Following her advice, I mailed Google Play support on 20th September. After two days, I received
                        a polite but disappointing response: they apologized for the inconvenience but said they
                        couldn’t help since it “violated their policies.” They suggested contacting the game developer
                        for the refund instead.

                        By that point, I had already gone through an exhausting loop of steps — automated bots, delayed
                        replies, vague instructions, and constant redirections. It was a tedious process that most
                        average users wouldn’t have the patience or knowledge to complete.

                        This entire incident revealed how unclear subscription systems and rigid refund policies can
                        easily mislead customers. While the visuals and wording on payment pages create an impression of
                        a free trial, the fine print — or the lack of it — tells a different story. I genuinely hope
                        platforms like Google Play make these policies more transparent to prevent others from facing
                        the same confusion and loss.</p>

                <div class="incident-summary">
                    <p><b>Brief summary:</b> A teacher's habit of downloading movies from torrent sites led to a
                        ransomware attack that encrypted all his files, with a demand for ₹2000 to restore them. He
                        reached out for help but never followed through, serving as a stark lesson on the real-world
                        cost of digital risks.</p>

                    <p><b>Full story:</b> A math teacher, who frequently downloaded movies from risky torrent sites,
                        found his laptop held hostage. All his personal files were encrypted, and a readme.txt sat on
                        his desktop, demanding a ₹2000 ransom for their return.

                        Feeling helpless, he reached out to a former student he knew was skilled with computers. During
                        the call, he anxiously asked about the student's well-being before revealing the crisis. He
                        promised to bring the laptop over for help.

                        However, the teacher never arrived. He broke the commitment, perhaps having found another
                        solution or resigned to his loss. The incident remained an unresolved lesson for the student—a
                        clear example of how digital dangers have very real and costly consequences.

                    <p class="show"><b>Full story:</b> You might be surprised to hear about a friend's early experiences
                        with computers. His
                        very first PC was technically genuine hardware, but it came with an unauthorized copy of
                        Windows. He noticed something was wrong almost immediately—his Chrome browser would pop up with
                        ads every couple of minutes. It turned out to be adware.

                        He followed online tutorials to clean it up. The scary part was realizing how sophisticated some
                        of these attacks were. They slowly tried to disable Windows Defender, and at one point, his
                        computer wouldn’t even restart properly. He even found changes deep in the system—like in the
                        Registry, where Windows manages app and system settings—with values being altered from 0 to 1.
                        He kept deleting those entries like a daily routine check until he finally decided to just
                        install a clean version of Windows 10 himself.

                        He's much more careful now and eventually built his current PC from scratch to avoid those kinds
                        of issues.</p>
