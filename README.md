A fully responsive and interactive personal portfolio website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
This project showcases my **skills, experience, digital awareness**, and **creative works**, while demonstrating **clean architecture**, **performance optimization**, and **modern UI/UX practices**.

## ✨ Features

* **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly across all screen sizes using `clamp()` and media queries.

* **Independent Home Page:** Fully functional even without global scripts or styles.

* **Typing Animation:** Dynamic display of skills and areas of expertise.

* **Gradient Text & Animated Headings:** Adds an elegant, modern visual appeal.

* **Modular Architecture:** Low coupling and high cohesion — each section operates independently.

* **Home & Work Sections:**

  * Moving, animated backgrounds to create an immersive and dynamic user experience.
  * Project cards with dynamic content generation.
  * Minimalist image slider with smooth transition effects, hover animations, and numbered navigation dots.
  * Optional **Download SRS** button available for select projects.

* **About & Insights Section:**

  * Interactive profile image responding to cursor movement for enhanced user engagement.
  * Education and experience cards with links to **HackerRank**, **LinkedIn**, and **LeetCode**.
  * Digital Awareness summary with **Read More / Read Less** toggles for concise or detailed viewing.
  * Writings section showcasing the author’s first novel with curly underline and gradient heading animations.

* **Contact Section:**

  * Custom form integrated with **Google Forms backend** for seamless submissions.
  * Regex validation implemented for all inputs.
  * Designed in **dark mode** for optimal eye comfort — even preferred by light-mode users.

* **Global Assets:**

  * Shared resources limited to `script-global.js` and `style-global.css` to minimize redundancy and improve maintainability.

* **Fallbacks:**

  * Each independent module includes lightweight backup logic to ensure functionality even if a global file fails.
